More documentation soon.

## Getting Started

1. Clone/Download the repo and open the `Movelii.sln` solution.
1. To deploy and test simply run the solution and enter your 0365/Exchange email credentials when prompted
    * I do not recommend opting into storing your credentials as it's easier to test in different accounts by not doing so

## Try it out

Once installed you should be able to launch the app by clicking on `Movelii` when reading and email then start typeing the name of the folder you wish to move the email into. You can hit enter to select the first found folder, or use the number keys or simply click on the folder you wish to move the email into.
